Summary of changes since GRTensorII 1.74:
==============================================================================

Release 1.76 (3 November 1999)

  * Fixes to raising indices for n>5
  * Fixes to automatic determination of index symmetries when indices
    are raised/lowered
  * qload() switches to metric if it has already been loaded.
  * Fixes to clearing of definitions via grundef()
  * Added initzero(), setcmpt(), getsym(), setsym() undocumented hacks.
  * Added expandsqrt(), expandtb() simplification routines.

Release 1.75 (August 1999)

  * Fixes a bug in index ordering in grdisplay() output. (Thanks to
      Jan Gutowski for pointing this out.)
  * Modified user-prompt for interactive functions (eg. makeg()).

Release 1.74 (27 July 1999)

  * Added check for name conflicts in autoAlias().
  * Fixed grtransform() based on source contributed by Edward Huff.

173 [27 May 99] dp  Added feature to enter basis vectors as differentials
                    in makeg()
172b[10 Feb 99] dp  Fixed index ordering problem in dispStr3.
                    Fixed support for >6 indices (grF_unassignLoopVars)
                    Fixed grdef() index parser for cbdn, pbdn

                    arguments of functions) in grdef().
                    Modified grsavedef() so save grdef() statements.
170 [31 May 98] dp  Fixed indices on lhs of grdisplay output so that
                    square brackets don't show up in R5 output.
169 [ 6 May 98] dp  Added recognition of derivative and basis
                    indices in grdef consistency checks.
                    Replaced kdelta function with a standard object
                    definition.
168 [15 Mar 98] dp  Added version 5 specific extra arg to `&proc`
167 [24 Feb 98] dp  Add index consistency check in grdef().
                    Fix grundef() to clear assigned objects and all index
                    combinations.
                    Added CMB.
166 [14 Feb 98] dp  Switch reference to `string' data-type to `name'
                    for compatibility with R5.
165 [05 Dec 97] dp  Added grOptionMessageLevel.
164 [04 Nov 97] dp  Fix assignment of grG_metric name in automatic creation
                    of the calc function by grdef().
163 [18 Sep 97] dp  Fix 1-term line-element entry in makeg(), output of
                    grsaveobj() in R3, added initFn.mpl.
162 [16 Sep 97] dp  Comment out `For the xxx metric' in output of grsaveoj()
                    Fix LieD[] operator.
156 [13 Mar 97] dp  Fix greqn2set bug discovered by Jim McClune.

1.38  Fix bWeylSq dependency
1.37  Fix grdef symmetry bug
1.36  Add grcalcd(), grOptionqloadPath and allow makeg to not save a metric
1.35  Add grOptionMemory to grcalc and gralterGuts
1.34  Fix C(dn,dn,dn,dn) dependancy
